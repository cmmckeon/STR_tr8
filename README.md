Code used in PhD Chapter 3:	Human footprint in addition to climate drives spatial patterns in European plants

Data needed to run associated code available on request, and will be released when chapter is submitted as a manuscript for publication.

Data needed for this project (see thesis for citations in full):

## species range metrics from Csergo et al., (2020)
- GRSmetrics_AFE_pol_50km_pol_line_mcp.csv

## phylogeny from Smith et al., (2018)

## climate data from bioclim at a 30 second resolution
- wc2/wc2.1_30s_bio_1.tif  (mean annual temperature (C*10))
- wc2/wc2.1_30s_bio_12.tif (mean annual precipatation (mm))
- wc2/wc2.1_30s_bio_15.tif  (mean annual precip coeff variation)
- wc2/wc2.1_30s_bio_4.tif (mean annual temp SD*100)

## human footprint data from SEDAC (Venter et al., 2018)
- Data_wildareas-v3-2009-human-footprint.tif

## Past climate change velocity data from Sandel et al., 2011
